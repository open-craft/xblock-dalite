"""
Unit tests for Dalite XBlock.

Tests in this package are supposed to run very quick (entire suite in seconds) and to be
extensively used in development process.

Tests in this package should not require DB, modulestore or runtime access - they should use mock
to provide mocks and stubs for any dependencies.
